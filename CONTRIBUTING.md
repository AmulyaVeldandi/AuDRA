## Contributing Guidelines

Thanks for helping improve AuDRA-Rad! We follow a few lightweight rules to keep collaboration smooth.

### Commit & Branching
- Use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) for clear history (`feat: add retriever stub`, `fix: handle null report`, etc.).
- Name branches by intent: `feat/*`, `fix/*`, `docs/*`, or `chore/*`.

### Pull Request Checklist
- ✅ Tests pass locally (or explain why none run).
- ✅ Linting passes or is addressed.
- ✅ Keep PRs focused and reasonably small so reviewers can respond quickly.

If something blocks you, open a draft PR or start a discussion in the issue tracker.

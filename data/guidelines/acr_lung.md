# ACR Lung-RADS® v2022 (Lung CT Screening Reporting & Data System)

Standardized assessment categories for low-dose CT lung cancer screening examinations developed by the American College of Radiology (ACR) in collaboration with the Society of Thoracic Radiology and other stakeholders.

## Scope and Eligibility
- Applies to asymptomatic adults undergoing annual low-dose CT screening who meet U.S. guideline criteria (age, smoking history, years since quitting).
- Not intended for diagnostic CT performed for symptoms or follow-up of known cancer.

## Category Definitions and Management
| Category | Risk estimate | Imaging descriptors | Management recommendation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0 – Incomplete | N/A | Prior imaging needed or technical issue; short-term follow-up required | Additional imaging (e.g., comparison with prior, repeat LDCT) |
| 1 – Negative | < 1% | No nodules or nodules with benign calcification pattern | Continue annual LDCT in 12 months |
| 2 – Benign appearance/behavior | < 1% | Solid nodules < 6 mm; new solid < 4 mm; pure ground-glass < 30 mm; part-solid < 6 mm total diameter | Continue annual LDCT in 12 months |
| 3 – Probably benign | 1–2% | Solid 6–8 mm (≥ 113 mm³); new 4–6 mm; part-solid ≥ 6 mm with solid < 6 mm; persistent ground-glass ≥ 30 mm | LDCT in 6 months |
| 4A – Suspicious | 5–15% | Solid 8–15 mm; new 6–8 mm; part-solid with solid 6–8 mm; endobronchial nodule; airway filling defect | LDCT in 3 months; consider PET/CT if solid component ≥ 8 mm |
| 4B / 4X – Very suspicious | ≥ 15% | Solid ≥ 15 mm or new/growing solid ≥ 8 mm; part-solid with solid ≥ 8 mm; suspected invasion, lymphadenopathy, or other high-risk features (4X) | PET/CT, tissue sampling, and/or surgical consultation depending on comorbidity and resectability |

## Special Notes
- **Growth definition:** Increase in mean diameter of ≥ 1.5 mm or clear volumetric growth; slow-growing nodules that do not meet growth criteria but show interval change may be upgraded to 4B/4X.
- **New nodules in previously negative scans** are categorized by size at detection (do not assume benignity).
- **Multiple nodules:** Assign the highest applicable category; report additional findings with their individual descriptors.
- **Resolved nodules:** If a prior category 3 or 4 lesion resolves, downgrade to category 2 for subsequent screening interval.
- **Extrapulmonary findings** should be reported separately following ACR incidental findings guidance.

# ACR Incidental Findings Committee – Management of Incidental Liver Lesions on CT (2017)

Guidance for incidentally detected focal liver lesions on contrast-enhanced CT performed for unrelated indications. Recommendations from the American College of Radiology (ACR) Incidental Findings Committee, 2017 white paper.

## Patient Risk Categories
- **Low risk:** No known malignancy, no hepatic dysfunction, and no hepatitis risk factors.
- **High risk:** Known primary malignancy with propensity to metastasize to the liver or chronic liver disease (e.g., cirrhosis, chronic hepatitis B/C).

## Imaging Features
- **Benign features:** Sharp margins; homogeneous very low attenuation (< 20 HU) lesions; classic appearance of cyst, hemangioma, focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH), or perfusional changes.
- **Suspicious features:** Arterial phase hyperenhancement with washout, ill-defined margins, heterogeneity, mural nodularity, thick septa, or growth compared with prior studies.

## Management by Lesion Size and Risk Category

### Low-Risk Patients
| Lesion size | Benign imaging features | Suspicious / indeterminate features |
| --- | --- | --- |
| < 1 cm | No additional imaging | No additional imaging |
| 1.0–1.5 cm | No additional imaging | Multiphasic liver MRI (preferred) or contrast-enhanced multiphasic CT |
| > 1.5 cm | No additional imaging if classic benign appearance | Multiphasic liver MRI; consider hepatobiliary-specific agent if differentiation from FNH/adenoma needed |

### High-Risk Patients
| Lesion size | Recommendation |
| --- | --- |
| < 1 cm | Multiphasic liver MRI at 3–6 months to assess for stability or characterization |
| 1.0–1.5 cm with benign features | No additional imaging |
| 1.0–1.5 cm with suspicious features | Prompt multiphasic liver MRI; consider contrast-enhanced ultrasound if MRI contraindicated |
| > 1.5 cm | Multiphasic liver MRI (preferred) or contrast-enhanced multiphasic CT; biopsy if imaging remains indeterminate |

## Additional Considerations
- **Growth assessment:** Increase in diameter ≥ 20% in ≤ 6 months or development of washout warrants expedited evaluation.
- **Contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS):** Useful when MRI is contraindicated; arterial phase hyperenhancement followed by late washout is suspicious for malignancy.
- **Lesions with hepatobiliary phase hypointensity** on gadoxetate-enhanced MRI require further evaluation even if small, particularly in patients at risk for hepatocellular carcinoma.
- **Follow-up completion:** Once stability is demonstrated at 1 year for high-risk patients with lesions < 1 cm, further surveillance generally not required unless new risk factors emerge.

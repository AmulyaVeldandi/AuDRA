# Fleischner Society Pulmonary Nodule Recommendations (2017)

Guidance for management of incidentally detected pulmonary nodules in adults aged 35 years or older based on Fleischner Society 2017 consensus. Excludes patients with a known cancer diagnosis, immunocompromised status, or nodules detected during lung cancer screening.

## Risk Stratification
- **Low risk:** Minimal or absent smoking history and no other risk factors for lung cancer.
- **High risk:** History of heavy smoking or other established lung cancer risk factors (e.g., asbestos exposure, family history).
- Imaging features suggesting malignancy (e.g., spiculated margins, growth, upper lobe location) warrant a more aggressive workup regardless of baseline risk.

## Single Solid Nodules
| Nodule size | Low-risk patients | High-risk patients |
| --- | --- | --- |
| < 6 mm (volume < 100 mm³) | No routine follow-up | Optional CT at 12 months if morphology suspicious or upper lobe |
| 6–8 mm (100–250 mm³) | CT at 6–12 months; consider CT at 18–24 months if unchanged | CT at 6–12 months **and** at 18–24 months if stable |
| > 8 mm (> 250 mm³) | Consider CT at 3 months, PET/CT, and/or tissue sampling | Same as low risk; choose modality based on probability of malignancy and comorbidities |

## Multiple Solid Nodules
| Nodule size | Low-risk patients | High-risk patients |
| --- | --- | --- |
| All nodules < 6 mm | No routine follow-up | Optional CT at 12 months |
| ≥ 1 nodule 6–8 mm | CT at 3–6 months; consider CT at 18–24 months if stable | CT at 3–6 months and at 18–24 months if stable |
| ≥ 1 nodule > 8 mm | CT at 3–6 months; evaluate most suspicious nodule as per single > 8 mm pathway | Same as low risk; subsequent management tailored to dominant lesion |

## Subsolid Nodules
### Single Ground-Glass Nodules
| Size | Recommendation |
| --- | --- |
| < 6 mm | No routine follow-up |
| ≥ 6 mm | CT at 6–12 months to confirm persistence; if persistent, CT every 2 years until 5 years |

### Single Part-Solid Nodules
| Size / Solid component | Recommendation |
| --- | --- |
| Total < 6 mm | No routine follow-up |
| ≥ 6 mm with solid component < 6 mm | CT at 3–6 months to confirm persistence; if unchanged, annual CT for 5 years |
| Solid component ≥ 6 mm | CT at 3 months, PET/CT, and/or tissue sampling; manage as potentially invasive adenocarcinoma |

### Multiple Subsolid Nodules
| Scenario | Recommendation |
| --- | --- |
| All nodules < 6 mm | CT at 3–6 months; if stable, consider CT at 2 and 4 years |
| Any nodule ≥ 6 mm | CT at 3–6 months; subsequent management driven by the most suspicious lesion following single-nodule guidance |

## Special Considerations
- Document nodule size using average of long- and short-axis diameters measured in the axial plane or volumetric assessment when available.
- Growth is defined as an increase of ≥ 2 mm in diameter or a decisive volumetric increase.
- Use thin-section (≤ 1.5 mm) low-dose CT techniques for follow-up imaging.
